# Field Painter
Splatoon-inspired command line-based game. Paint more than your opponent... If you can play this mess.

The original version was written back around January of 2019. The code is awful and the game is not even close to playable in its current state.

I might get around to working on it sometime later, improving it and making it more playable.
